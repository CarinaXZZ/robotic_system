function [ angle, distance ] = pathplanning( start_point, end_point, external_boundaries, robot_size )
% Function which calculates and returns the length and angle of the path
% between points waypoints p1(x1, y1) and p2(x2, y2). This allows the
% robot's estimated path from start_point to end_point to be identified, so
% that the required translation and rotation can be performed by the robot.

%% Estimate a path from a given start point to a given end point
%tic % time taken to estimate a path
