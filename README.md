Developed a robot simulator using Matlab to solve the localisation and path planning problem of the kidnapped robot. 
The robot could localise inside various maps using the particle filter method, and then used A* as a path planning algorithm to reach a specified target location. 
The simulator was adapted to a robot built with Lego NXT which could deal with the noise of the sensor and avoid collisions.
